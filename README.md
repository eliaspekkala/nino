# nino
A small terminal-based text editor written in C.

I made this a while ago following [snaptoken's Build Your Own Text Editor tutorial](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/)

Also, see the original text editor the tutorial based on: [kilo](https://github.com/antirez/kilo)

## New features
- Line numbers
- Auto indent
- Auto bracket completion
- Selected text
- Go to line number
